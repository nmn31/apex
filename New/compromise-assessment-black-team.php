                <h3>What is a Compromise Assessment?</h3>
                <p>A Compromise Assessment is a proactive investigation aimed at identifying evidence of malicious activity within your environment. Conducted by our expert Black Team, this assessment evaluates your systems, networks, and endpoints for indicators of compromise (IoCs), providing insights into both current and historical threats.</p>
                <p>This assessment is ideal for organizations that suspect a breach or want to confirm the integrity of their IT infrastructure without waiting for signs of compromise to appear.</p>
